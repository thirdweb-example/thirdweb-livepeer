# Token Gated Videos

This project demonstrates how you can restrict video content to only those users who own a token of your choice (any ERC-20), any wallet address or both.

## Tools:

- [thirdweb SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react): To access the connected wallet, switch the user's network and RPC link
- [Livepeer.js](https://docs.livepeer.org/reference/livepeer-js): To handle video upload, playback and access control.
